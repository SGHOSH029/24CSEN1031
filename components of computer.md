1. Motherboard
A complete computer components list always starts with the motherboard, the primary circuit board that holds all the hardware in place. Every PC has one, from dedicated workstations to personal notebooks. A robust motherboard offers many slots for installing multiple computer components (e.g. RAM, graphics card, etc.).


Motherboards offer different form factors (general specs encompassing circuitry arrangement, overall size, number of ports, etc.), and only specific motherboard models can fit into certain computer cases/chassis, especially for customisable desktops.

For laptops, specialised motherboards are used instead, with much of their built-in hardware already soldered onto their respective circuits permanently. This is done due to the laptop’s smaller frame and lighter build, with only certain parts like the RAM and storage that can be upgraded.

When a motherboard is damaged, PCs cease to function fully. Noting the complexity of the circuitry and wiring in place, a faulty motherboard can instantly stop your computer from working and potentially harm other parts. While motherboards are easily replaced for desktops, the same can’t be said for laptops, forcing you to buy a brand new one.

2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The central processing unit (CPU) - commonly referred to as the processor - is the ‘brain’ of your computer. The CPU solves all the sophisticated algorithms and programming your computer does while running programs or applications.

Nowadays, almost all processors possess multiple CPUs to achieve quicker processing speeds, ensuring faster response times when using software or browsing the web. These special processors are called multi-core processors, with each CPU designated as 1 processing core. 


For example, the high-end Intel® Core™ i7-12850HX processor has 16 independent cores that work together to handle computing tasks, allowing you to do program-intensive work without stressing your computer too much.

You can squeeze more power from your CPUs to get slight performance boosts by overclocking them. However, this comes with risks that might damage your processor, so keep that in mind. Remember, a PC cannot work properly with an impaired processor, even if other components function normally.

3. Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)
When handling graphical operations and advanced imagery, the graphical processing unit (GPU) is the computer hardware responsible for it. A GPU is required for your computer to read and reproduce graphical representations and effects, which are almost present in every form of media today.

Certain top-spec CPUs can also have basic GPUs embedded in them, especially premium laptops that focus on lightweight mobility and use. However, the finest GPUs are primarily used for video gaming, capable of handling immense 3D-graphics loads to maintain smooth frame rates and lag-free experiences.

When gaming, the CPU and GPU work in tandem. The GPU manages the heavy lifting in terms of the on-screen graphics and fidelity, while the CPU runs the programming that works behind the scenes, such as data and in-game statistics.


A broken-down GPU can lead to many problems, including the feared black screen of death. The current crisis of GPU chips shortages causes another headache, making losing your GPU a nightmare.

4. Random Access Memory (RAM)
Computers have different forms of memory that store information and data, and the more prominently discussed is random-access memory (RAM). A RAM device keeps important currently-used data and codes on standby, loading them instantly when respective programs or apps are opened.

RAM is a volatile type of memory, meaning all stored memory is refreshed after turning off the PC. This allows the device to quickly absorb new data immediately during the next session, prompting quicker loading processes.

Almost all mainstream computers can be upgraded with more RAM by buying a better RAM device - or RAM stick - that offers bigger storage capacity, including mini laptops. Nevertheless, depending on your computing activities, you might not use all RAM, so you need to understand how much RAM is ideal for your PC according to its primary use (work, gaming, etc.).

Although a damaged RAM stick might not necessarily disrupt your computer from working properly, it will hinder its performance over time, resulting in program crashes, unexpected decrease in RAM, and failure to boot, among others.

5. Storage device
A storage device provides the memory for installing programs and saving files. Unlike RAM, a storage device’s content is secured in non-volatile memory, meaning that data is saved permanently inside its memory bank, preserving them even after you turn off the PC (unless manually deleted or uninstalled).

PCs use 2 common types of internal storage devices: hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SDDs). HDDs are the cheaper option but suffer from slower transfer speeds, while SDDs are their superior counterparts but are more expensive. These devices are attached to your computer using dedicated SATA cables, replaced by SAS cables for big servers and workstations.

Other secondary storage devices exist, such as USB flash drives and portable HDDs. However, these peripherals are not installed inside computers. Instead, they are connected to the PC via alternative channels like USB ports or external disk drives, depending on the specs.

Even though storage devices do not impact your computer’s boot-up process, start-up programs like Google Chrome or Microsoft Word are loaded directly from your HDD or SDD. So a damaged storage device can interrupt the whole process, potentially corrupting your files. If so, you will need to replace your hard drive immediately, sometimes requiring a complete system reformat or Windows reinstall, which is a hassle.
